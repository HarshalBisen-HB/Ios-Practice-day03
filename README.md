# iOS Basic Learning Project

## Overview
This project is a basic iOS application developed using Xcode for self-learning purposes. It covers fundamental concepts such as UI design, user input handling, and form validation.

## Features
- User authentication with form validation.
- Basic UI components (buttons, text fields, labels, etc.).
- Navigation between screens.
- Error handling and input validation.
- Utilization of Swift and SwiftUI/UIKit.

## Validation Implementation
The project includes validation for user input fields, ensuring proper data entry. The following validations are implemented:
- **Email Validation:** Ensures the email format is correct using regular expressions.
- **Password Validation:** Enforces minimum length and special character requirements.
- **Empty Field Checks:** Prevents users from submitting forms with empty fields.
- **Phone Number Validation:** Verifies phone number format and length.
